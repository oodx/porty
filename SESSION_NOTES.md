## ðŸ“‹ Next Sprint Candidates

**Remaining tasks in TASKS.txt backlog:**

### Quick Wins (2-3 SP)
- **SP-007: Default Command Configuration [2 SP]** - Configure RSB to default to 'start' command
- **SP-008d: HTTP Cookie Support [3 SP]** - Parse/forward cookies, session routing

### Medium Tasks (5-8 SP)
- **SP-010: Production Readiness [8 SP]** - Connection pooling optimization, advanced error handling

### Technical Debt (1-2 SP)
- **TD-001: Unused PortyArgs Struct [1 SP]** - Clean up old args.rs code
- **TD-002: HTTP Module println! Conversion [1 SP]** - Convert remaining println! to echo!

## ðŸš€ Project Status

**Total Story Points Completed:** 34+ SP across 2 completed sprints
**Key Achievements:**
- Complete RSB framework integration (78% code reduction in main.rs)
- Full HTTP dynamic routing with query parameters
- Host header routing with fallback
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Production-ready configuration examples
- Professional documentation suite

**Architecture Status:**
- âœ… RSB patterns fully implemented
- âœ… HTTP/TCP dual-mode support
- âœ… Dynamic routing operational
- âœ… Error handling robust
- âœ… Documentation comprehensive

## ðŸ”„ Session Continuation

**For next session:**
1. **SP-007** would be a good quick win (RSB default command)
2. **SP-008d** would add cookie support for session management
3. **SP-010** would polish production readiness features

**Background processes were running during this session:**
- Multiple test servers for HTTP routing validation
- Log monitoring processes
- All processes should be cleaned up before continuation

**Git Status:**
- SP-009 documentation work ready to commit
- All examples and docs created and tested
- README enhanced with RSB patterns

**Development Environment:**
- Examples directory fully populated and tested
- Documentation suite complete
- RSB framework integration stable
- All HTTP features operational

Continue tomorrow with SP-007 for quick UX improvement or SP-008d for advanced HTTP features.
